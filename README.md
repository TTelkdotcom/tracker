# tracker

This is a very basic PHP tracking application to directly follow specific people around your web page, just create a folder where the analytic should be stored and choose your link. The basic layout is *yourdomain.com/r/yourtrackingid* the tracking id can be anything, numbers, words, random letters, just make sure that there's no signs in it. Now you need to note who this id is for and then you can start, send the link to anyone and once they click it, you'll be able to follow them around your site for this session until they close their browser.
